Description:
    en: Customized version of rails's scaffold_controller, to be used after leolay.
    it: Versione personalizzata dello scaffold_controller di rails, da usare dopo leolay.

    Stubs out a scaffolded controller and its views. Pass the model name,
    either CamelCased or under_scored, and a list of views as arguments.
    The controller name is retrieved as a pluralized version of the model
    name.

    To create a controller within a module, specify the model name as a
    path like 'parent_module/controller_name'.

    This generates a controller class in app/controllers and invokes helper,
    template engine and test framework generators.

Example:
    `rails generate leosca_controller CreditCard`

    Credit card controller with URLs like /credit_card/debit.
        Controller:      app/controllers/credit_cards_controller.rb
        Functional Test: test/functional/credit_cards_controller_test.rb
        Views:           app/views/credit_cards/index.html.erb [...]
        Helper:          app/helpers/credit_cards_helper.rb
